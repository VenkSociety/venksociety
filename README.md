#### 👋 Who am I?
Hi, I'm Venk and I design websites, web-apps and software. My languages consist of **HTML/CSS**, **PHP/SQL**, **JavaScript**, **C#** and **Python**. I'm currently **not available** for hire but this could change soon.

#### ⭐ Some of my more noticeable projects are:
 [💀 Tsuyo](github.com/VenkSociety/Tsuyo), an open-source Discord bot for moderating your server.
 ClassiCube.
 
 [💬 Comiq](https://comiqapp.com), an upcoming comic-making and sharing social network.
